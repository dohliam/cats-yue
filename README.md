# 賈斯娜的貓貓 - Cantonese version of Cats of Jasnah

Cats of Jasnah is a web based game for learning categories and logic.

This game is aimed at developing logical language skills for children aged 2-5. It progresses from counting up to increasingly difficult word problems using boolean logic. This seems like a more intutive path for her to learn at her current level of development and I couldn't find something like this elsewhere.

Enjoy!
